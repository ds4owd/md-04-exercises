## Import

## Task 1: Import waste data as CSV

1.  Run all code chunks above.
2.  Use the `read_csv()` function to import the `waste-city-level.csv` file from the `data/raw` folder.
3.  Assign the resulting data to an object called `waste`.

```{r}
waste <- read_csv("data/raw/waste-city-level.csv")
```

## Task 2: Import JMP data as CSV

1.  Use the `read_csv()` function to import the `jmp_wld_sanitation_long.csv` file from the `data/processed` folder.
2.  Assign the resulting data to an object called `san_csv`.

```{r}
san_csv <- read_csv("data/processed/jmp_wld_sanitation_long.csv")
```

## Task 3: Import JMP data as RDS

1.  Use the `read_rds()` function to import the `jmp_wld_sanitation_long.rds` file from the `data/processed` folder.
2.  Assign the resulting data to an object called `san_rds`.

```{r}
san_rds <- read_rds("data/processed/jmp_wld_sanitation_long.rds")
```

## Task 4: Compare CSV and RDS

1.  Use the `glimpse()` function to inspect the `san_csv` and `san_rds` objects.
2.  What is the difference between the two objects? Discuss with your room partner.

```{r}
glimpse(san_csv)
glimpse(san_rds)
```

## Task 5: Use LLM for an explanation

1.  Open <https://www.perplexity.ai/> in your browser and enter the following prompt:

You are an experienced educator in teaching R to novice users without prior knowledge. Explain what the .rds format is and how it differs from the .csv file format. Avoid technical language.

2.  Read the answer and ask the tool questions for clarification of something is unclear.

3.  Share a link to your conversation here (see screenshot below):
